      <p>
        W3C-specific note: This specification documents current RFC 3986 and RFC 3987 handling in
        contemporary Web browser implementations. As a consequence, this specification is not compatible
        with those RFCs. It is published for the purpose of providing a stable reference for
        the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/">HTML5 specification</a> and reflecting current Web browser HTML5
        implementations. The W3C Technical Architecture Group expects to continue the work on the URL
        specification and produce a future version that will attempt to re-align the URL specification
        with an updated version of RFC 3986 while preserving interoperability.
